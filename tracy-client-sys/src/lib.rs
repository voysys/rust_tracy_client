//! Low level API to the Tracy Client
//!
//! This crate embeds the C++ tracy client library and exposes its API. For a higher-level API
//! consider `tracy-client`.
//!
//! # Important note
//!
//! Simply depending on this crate is sufficient for tracy to be enabled at program startup, even
//! if none of the APIs provided by this crate are invoked. Tracy will broadcast discovery packets
//! to the local network and expose the data it collects in the background to that same network.
//! Traces collected by Tracy may include source and assembly code as well.
//!
//! As thus, you may want make sure to only enable the `tracy-client-sys` crate conditionally, via
//! the `enable` feature flag provided by this crate.
